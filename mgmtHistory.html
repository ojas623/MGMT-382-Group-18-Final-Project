<h1><font color = "blue">Tekton - Building Solutions for Small and Medium Sized Developers</font><h1>
<br>
<br>
<h3>Tekton was founded in 2015 by Joe Smith and Allison Hart. Joe and Allison recognized that smaller projects did not have access to the same level of support, and certainly not in a cost effective way, that larger building developers had. Tekton was created to full this gap. By providing state of the art construction management and purchasing solutions for its clients, Tekton has grown to over 100 employees and today is the largest priveatly owned construction management firm in Indiana.</h3>
